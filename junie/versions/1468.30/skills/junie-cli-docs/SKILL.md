# Junie CLI documentation

Use this skill when you need complete Junie CLI documentation.
The full documentation bundle is embedded below

**IMPORTANT**: The agent cannot directly execute Junie CLI commands (such as `new`, `usage`, `model`, etc.).
The agent can only suggest to the user which commands to run.

### Quickstart

# Quickstart

<show-structure for="chapter,procedure" depth="3"/>

**Junie CLI** is the agentic coding tool by JetBrains that provides an interactive terminal interface for developers to 
review, write, and modify code.

<procedure title="Supported operating systems" id="supported-operating-systems">
Junie CLI is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
</procedure>

## Step 1: Install Junie CLI {level="3"}

In the terminal or command prompt of your choice, run:

<tabs>
    <tab title="Linux / macOS">
        <code-block lang="Console">curl -fsSL https://junie.jetbrains.com/install.sh | bash</code-block>
    </tab>
    <tab title="Windows">
        <code-block lang="PowerShell">powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex (irm 'https://junie.jetbrains.com/install.ps1')"</code-block>
    </tab>
    <tab title="Homebrew">
            <code-block lang="Console">
                brew tap jetbrains/junie
                brew update
                brew install junie
            </code-block>
            <p>
                To verify the installation:
            </p>
            <code-block lang="Console">
                junie --version
            </code-block>
    </tab>
</tabs>

[//]: # (EAP channel:)

[//]: # (<code-block lang="Console">curl -fsSL https://junie.jetbrains.com/install-eap.sh | bash</code-block>)

## Step 2: Start Junie in your project {level="3"}

Navigate to the root directory of the project where you want to use Junie CLI and run `junie`:

```console
cd /path/to/your/project
```

```sh
junie
```

## Step 3: Authenticate {level="3"}

On the Junie welcome screen, select one of the available authentication options:

* **Log in with your JetBrains Account**

    Use Junie CLI as part of your subscription plan with JetBrains. When selecting this option, you'll be redirected to 
the JetBrains Junie login page in your browser.

* **Use `JUNIE_API_KEY`** 

    Run Junie CLI with usage-based billing. When selecting this option, you'll be prompted to provide an access 
token. To generate your `JUNIE_API_KEY` access token, go to [junie.jetbrains.com/cli](https://junie.jetbrains.com/cli).

* **[Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)](BYOK.md)**

    Use your own API keys or OAuth tokens from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or other third-party LLM providers.
    Junie CLI uses these API keys to send requests to LLMs directly without requiring a JetBrains AI subscription.

    BYOK can be used on its own or together with JetBrains Account authorization or Junie API key.
    If a model is available through both the BYOK API key and JetBrains AI subscription, the requests are billed to your BYOK provider directly.

[//]: # (> By authenticating with Junie CLI, you agree to [Junie Terms of Service]&#40;https://junie.jetbrains.com/tos-eap&#41;.)

[//]: # (> {style="note"})

## Step 4: Type your prompt {level="3"} 

Type the prompt in the interactive CLI, for example:

```Console
> give me an overview of this codebase
```

Use `@` to attach a file or folder from the current project to the request context. 
To see the list of available slash commands and use them, type `/`.

[Learn more about using Junie in the terminal](Junie-CLI-usage.md)

## Non-interactive (headless) mode {level="3"}

You can run Junie CLI in headless mode, that is, programmatically without interactive UI, in CI/CD environments
and build pipelines. 

To add Junie to your CI/CD script:

```bash
# Install Junie CLI
curl -fsSL https://junie.jetbrains.com/install.sh | bash

# Authenticate and use Junie
junie --auth="$JUNIE_API_KEY" "Review and fix any code quality issues in the latest commit"
```
The `junie` command takes [options](Parameters.md) and [environment variables](Parameters.md#environment-variables). 

For more information and examples, see [Headless mode](Junie-headless.md).

## Other scenarios {level="3"}

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="2" />

Learn about working with Junie CLI in an interactive terminal interface.

## Prompting

With Junie CLI [installed and authenticated](Junie-CLI.md), navigate to the project directory where you want to use it.

1. Start an interactive session with Junie CLI.

    ```
    junie
    ```

2. Type your prompt in the natural language, for example:

    ```
    > find the files in this project that handle log error descriptions
    ```

[//]: # (Tabs are normalized to spaces: when you type or paste a tab character into the input field, it is converted to two spaces. )

[//]: # (This ensures consistent rendering and cursor alignment in the terminal. Practical effect:)

[//]: # (- Typing the Tab key inserts two spaces.)

[//]: # (- Pasting text that contains tabs &#40;for example, code snippets&#41; will have each tab replaced with two spaces.)
  
> For persistent guidance that Junie CLI will apply to all tasks, provide instructions in the `.junie/AGENTS.md` 
> file at the project's root directory. [Learn more](Guidelines-and-memory.md)

### Real-time follow-ups

You can type follow-up prompts while Junie CLI is working on the task without waiting for it to finish. 
The added clarifications are appended to the initial prompt and taken into account by the agent immediately.

### Reference files and directories

Use `@` to quickly reference files or directories in your prompt.

[//]: # (When you include file paths directly in the prompt using the `@<path>` syntax, the CLI now validates those paths and sends only the ones that actually exist on your machine.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- Non-existent paths are ignored silently and are not attached to the request.)

[//]: # (- Existing paths are attached and will be available to Junie during task processing.)

[//]: # (- Use your OS-native path format &#40;the CLI checks paths using the local filesystem&#41;.)

![](reference_files_and_folders.png){width="706"}

You can also drag and drop files and images into the terminal window to reference them.

### Image inputs

Drag and drop or reference screenshots or design specs in the prompt for Junie CLI to read the image details. 
Junie CLI accepts all common image formats such as PNG and JPEG.

### Search the prompt history

Junie CLI preserves your prompt history across all sessions and application runs. 

To search the prompt history, use `Ctrl+R`, and then navigate through the results using Up and Down arrow keys.

## Slash commands and shortcuts

Slash commands allow you to access various Junie CLI features directly from the prompt.
Type `/` in the prompt to see and use the [available slash commands](Slash-commands.md).

In addition to the built-in commands, you can [add custom slash commands](Custom-slash-commands.md) for frequently used prompts and
repetitive tasks.

To see all available shortcuts, type `?`.

## Run shell commands

You can run shell commands without leaving Junie CLI by prefixing it with `!`, for example:

```
!ls -la
```

## Command approval

For running potentially sensitive actions, such as executing most of the terminal commands, 
editing files outside the project, or invoking MCP tools, Junie will ask for approval from the user.

### Action Allowlist

When Junie CLI stops for user approval, you can select the **→ Always allow** option to add 
the indicated command to the Action Allowlist. Once on the Action Allowlist, the command will always be executed 
without user approval in the future Junie runs.

![](action_allowlist_junie_cli.png){width="706"}

The full list of allowed commands and command patterns is stored in the `~/.junie/allowlist.json` file. You can also 
edit this file manually to add or remove allowed or restricted commands and patterns. For details, see 
[Action Allowlist configuration](Action-Allowlist-Junie-CLI.md).

### Brave mode

You can authorize Junie CLI to execute all potentially sensitive actions without user approval by enabling brave mode
with the `Ctrl+B` shortcut.

![](brave_mode_on.png){width="706"}

## Plan mode

In plan mode, Junie CLI analyzes the codebase with read-only operations and creates an implementation plan without
making any changes to the project files.

To toggle plan mode, use the `Shift+Tab` shortcut.   

![](plan_mode_enabled.png){width="706"}

Junie will suggest a plan and wait for the user input – either confirmation or rejection to proceed with the implementation.
If you reject the plan, provide follow-up instructions to continue:

![](reject_the_plan.png){width="706"}

[//]: # (## Terminal mode)

[//]: # (You can run shell commands directly within Junie to inspect your project or run tests:)

[//]: # (1. Type `!` followed by your command &#40;e.g., `!./gradlew test`&#41;.)

[//]: # (2. Junie will execute the command and display the output.)

[//]: # (3. You can also type `/terminal` to enter a persistent terminal session.)

## Faster results mode

*Faster results* mode speeds up Junie CLI on the fly while your prompt is being run.
To enable faster results mode, use the `Ctrl+F` shortcut.

![](working_faster_mode.png){width="706"}

## Manage your account

Use the `/account` command to manage your credentials and API keys:

* Select **Junie Account** to authenticate with Junie CLI via JetBrains Account or a Junie API key. 

  To generate a `JUNIE_API_KEY` access token, go to [junie.jetbrains.com/cli](https://junie.jetbrains.com/cli).

* Select **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** to add API keys for LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or xAI.

    > BYOK can be used on its own or together with JetBrains Account authorization.
    > If a model is available through both the BYOK API key and JetBrains AI subscription, 
  > the requests are billed directly to the model provider without consuming credits from your JetBrains account.

## Manage your session

### Clear up session context

Use `/new` to clear up the context of the current session and start a new session in Junie CLI interactive mode.

### View session transcript

To access the full transcript of the current session, including all previous prompts and the agent output,
use the `Ctrl+T` shortcut.
When in the Transcript view, use `Ctrl+N` to load older entries, or `Esc` to return to the main view.

### Resume previous sessions

To see the session history and resume one of the previous sessions, use `/history`.

[//]: # (> Resuming a session automatically enables **Fast Mode** to optimize the context for continuing the task.)

Junie CLI stores the full session context, including LLM usage data and the history of user prompts and agent responses, 
for the last 10 sessions.

### Quit the session

To exit the Junie CLI interactive mode without losing login credentials, use `/quit`.
Alternatively, you can exit Junie CLI by using `Ctrl+C` twice.

## Model selection

Use `/model` to select the LLM used for the current session. `Default` is the recommended
pre-selected option that uses a dynamically set model with the best price quality ratio.

The selection of available models depends on your [authentication method](Junie-CLI.md#step-3-authenticate) with Junie CLI. 
With BYOK, only the provider-specific models are available.

## Token usage and costs

The `/usage` command shows the cost breakdown for the current session, including token usage, used models, and remaining balance.

### Junie CLI and JetBrains IDE integration

# Junie CLI and JetBrains IDE integration

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="3" />

This page describes how Junie CLI integrates with JetBrains IDEs, what products are supported, which features depend on the JetBrains IDE connection, and how to inspect the connection with `/ide`.

## What JetBrains IDE integration does

When JetBrains IDE integration is available, Junie CLI can connect to the Junie plugin running inside a JetBrains IDE for the same project and use JetBrains IDE awareness for that session.

This improves features that depend on project understanding inside the IDE, such as symbol-aware search, safer code edits, code inspections, test workflows, and product-specific actions.

JetBrains IDE integration requires the Junie IDE plugin. For installation and setup details, see [Junie IDE plugin](Junie-IDE-plugin.md).

JetBrains IDE integration is passive from the CLI side:

- The IDE plugin becomes available automatically when you open the same project.
- The CLI discovers running IDE sessions automatically.
- The CLI selects the best matching JetBrains IDE for the current working directory.
- The CLI connects to the JetBrains IDE only when IDE-backed features are needed or when you inspect the state with `/ide`.

> Junie CLI currently supports only JetBrains IDEs for this integration. It does not connect to non-JetBrains editors or IDEs.
> {style="note"}

## Supported JetBrains IDEs

The current IDE discovery implementation supports these JetBrains IDEs:

- IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, PhpStorm, RubyMine, RustRover, CLion, and Rider

Support means that the CLI can detect installed and running instances of these products and match them to the current project when the Junie plugin is available.

## What features are affected

The JetBrains IDE connection affects user-visible features that benefit from the IDE understanding your project.

In practice, JetBrains IDE integration can improve tasks such as:

- Code search with symbol awareness and project indexes
- Code edits that use the IDE understanding of your project structure
- Code inspections and structure-aware analysis
- Test discovery and test execution from the IDE project context
- Refactorings and other project-aware changes
- Product-specific workflows in IDEs such as CLion or Rider

JetBrains IDE integration also improves `@` completions in the prompt. When the IDE is connected, Junie CLI can suggest not only project files and folders, but also classes and symbols known to the connected JetBrains IDE.

The CLI can also use JetBrains IDE context for the session, such as which files are currently open in the IDE.

If no JetBrains IDE is connected, Junie CLI can still work, but IDE-backed capabilities are unavailable.

## Requirements

For JetBrains IDE integration to work:

- Open the target project in a supported JetBrains IDE
- Make sure the Junie plugin is installed and running
- Open the same project so the IDE integration can start
- Run Junie CLI from the same project or a child directory of that project

If the project paths do not match, the CLI will not select that IDE session.

## Use the `/ide` command

Use `/ide` in Junie CLI to inspect the current JetBrains IDE integration state.

What `/ide` does:

- Lists running IDEs and their states
- Allows you to switch between multiple IDEs and projects
- Helps install the plugin if it is missing

### Possible states

| State | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `Connected` | The CLI is connected to that JetBrains IDE and can use JetBrains IDE-backed features |
| `Connecting…` | The CLI found a matching JetBrains IDE and is opening the connection |
| `Auth required` | The JetBrains IDE session is running, but the current connection is no longer authorized |
| `Error` | The JetBrains IDE was found, but the connection failed for another reason |
| `Ready` | The Junie plugin for that JetBrains IDE is available and can be selected |
| `Missing` | The Junie plugin is not installed for that JetBrains IDE |
| `Not responding` | The Junie plugin is installed, but it is not responding |
| `Unsupported` | That JetBrains IDE version is too old for Junie IDE integration |

### Notes

- `/ide` is a status command. It does not start a JetBrains IDE or enable JetBrains IDE integration by itself.
- The available features depend on the connected JetBrains IDE, the open project, and which capabilities are available in that session.
- If several JetBrains IDEs are running, the CLI prefers the one whose project path matches the current working directory most closely.
- `/ide` reports only JetBrains IDE integration state. It does not represent support for other editors or IDEs.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
|---------|---------------|
| `/ide` shows `Missing` | Install the Junie plugin for that JetBrains IDE, then wait a moment and run `/ide` again |
| `/ide` shows `Auth required` | Restart the JetBrains IDE, then run `/ide` again. If the problem stays, inspect `~/.junie/logs/junie.log` |
| `/ide` shows `Not responding` | Check whether the Junie plugin is enabled and update it to the latest version if needed |
| `/ide` shows `Error` | Check `~/.junie/logs/junie.log` for the connection error and verify that the JetBrains IDE project path matches the CLI working directory |
| `/ide` shows `Unsupported` | Update that JetBrains IDE to version `2026.1` or newer |
| `/ide` shows few available features after connecting | Verify that the JetBrains IDE session is fully loaded for that project and that the required JetBrains IDE features are available for that product and project |

### Junie CLI configuration files

# Junie CLI configuration files

Junie CLI can load settings from JSON configuration files in addition to command-line flags and environment variables.
Configuration files are useful when you want to keep shared project defaults in the repository or define personal defaults once for all projects.

## Default configuration locations

By default, Junie CLI looks for `config.json` in these locations:

* **User scope**: `~/.junie/config.json`
* **Project scope**: `<project-root>/.junie/config.json`

The project-level configuration is intended for settings that should be shared with the whole team.
The user-level configuration is intended for personal defaults on your machine.

## Configuration precedence

When the same setting is defined in multiple places, Junie resolves it in this order
(highest priority first):

1. Command-line flags
2. User settings from `~/.junie/settings.json`
3. Project configuration from `<project-root>/.junie/config.json`
4. User configuration from `~/.junie/config.json`

For example, if `~/.junie/config.json` sets `"model": "sonnet"`, the project config sets `"model": "gpt"`,
and you run `junie --model opus`, the effective model is `opus`.

## Add extra configuration files

To load additional configuration files, use `--config-location`.
You can specify it multiple times:

```bash
junie \
  --config-location /opt/company/junie/config.json \
  --config-location ./configs/junie.local.json
```

To disable loading from the default user and project locations, use `--config-default-locations false`.

For CI, you can use the equivalent environment variables:

| Environment variable | CLI equivalent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| <code-block>JUNIE_CONFIG_LOCATION</code-block> | <code-block>--config-location</code-block> | Additional configuration file paths. Can be specified multiple times. |
| <code-block>JUNIE_CONFIG_DEFAULT_LOCATIONS</code-block> | <code-block>--config-default-locations</code-block> | Enable or disable loading `config.json` from the default user and project locations. Defaults to `true`. |

## Supported configuration fields

The following JSON fields are currently supported in `config.json`:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `model` | Default model to use. For supported built-in model IDs and custom model profiles, see [Model selection](Junie-CLI-Model-selection.md) and [Custom LLM models](Custom-LLM-models.md). |
| `provider` | Default BYOK provider. For supported provider values, see [LLM providers](Junie-CLI-Model-selection.md#llm-providers). |
| `brave` | Enables brave mode by default. |
| `flags` | Additional feature flags. |
| `mcp-locations` | Extra folders where Junie should search for MCP configurations. |
| `mcp-default-locations` | Enable or disable the default MCP locations. |
| `skill-locations` | Extra folders where Junie should search for agent skills. |
| `skill-default-locations` | Enable or disable the default skill locations. |
| `command-locations` | Extra folders where Junie should search for custom slash commands. |
| `command-default-locations` | Enable or disable the default custom slash command locations. |
| `agent-locations` | Extra folders where Junie should search for custom agents. |
| `agent-default-location` | Enable or disable the default custom agent locations. |
| `model-locations` | Extra folders where Junie should search for custom model profiles. |
| `model-default-locations` | Enable or disable the default model locations. |
| `auto-update` | Enable or disable automatic update checks. |
| `guidelines-location` | Path to the guidelines file Junie should use. |
| `time-limit` | Default task time limit. |
| `byok` | Default BYOK API keys for supported providers. |
| `proxies` | Custom proxy endpoints for routing LLM traffic. See [Custom proxies](Custom-proxies.md). |

Relative paths in `config.json` are resolved relative to the folder that contains that configuration file.

## Example configuration file

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "brave": false,
  "flags": ["copilot"],
  "mcp-locations": ["./mcp", "./shared/mcp"],
  "mcp-default-locations": true,
  "skill-locations": ["./skills"],
  "skill-default-locations": true,
  "command-locations": ["./commands"],
  "command-default-locations": true,
  "agent-locations": ["./agents"],
  "agent-default-location": true,
  "model-locations": ["./models"],
  "model-default-locations": true,
  "auto-update": true,
  "guidelines-location": "./team-guidelines.md",
  "time-limit": 3600,
  "byok": {
    "anthropic": "sk-ant-...",
    "openai": "sk-..."
  },
  "proxies": [
    {
      "name": "my-proxy",
      "kind": "Ingrazzio",
      "api-url": "https://my-ingrazzio-instance.example.com",
      "headers": ["X-Custom-Header: value"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How configuration combines with other features

Configuration files control discovery for several other Junie CLI features:

* [MCP configuration](Junie-CLI-MCP-configuration.md)
* [Agent skills](Agent-Skills.md)
* [Custom slash commands](Custom-slash-commands.md)
* [Custom LLM models](Custom-LLM-models.md)
* [Guidelines and memory](Guidelines-and-memory.md)
* [Custom proxies](Custom-proxies.md)

For the exact command-line flags, see [CLI reference](Parameters.md).

### Action Allowlist

# Add commands to Action Allowlist

If [brave mode](Junie-CLI-usage.md#brave-mode) is not explicitly enabled, Junie will ask for user approval before 
running terminal commands, MCP tools, and other [types of actions](Action-Allowlist.md#types-of-action-allowlist-rules) 
that are considered to be sensitive by the coding agent.

You can manually add or remove allowed commands by editing the `~/.junie/allowlist.json` file.

There are three types of actions that can be allowed with the `allowlist.json` file:

* `fileEditing` – Editing files outside the project directory where Junie CLI is launched; editing build scripts outside 
    or inside the project directory.
* `executables` – Running terminal commands, including execution of tests, running apps, or build actions.
* `mcpTools` – Usage of Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.
* `readOutsideProject` – Reading files outside the current project directory where Junie CLI is launched.

An example `allowlist.json` file looks as follows:

```json
{
  "defaultBehavior": "ask",
  "allowReadonlyCommands": true,
  "rules": {
    "fileEditing": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "prefix": "src/main/kotlin/", // The path is relative to the current project directory. For absolute paths, start with `/`.
          "action": "allow"
        }
      ]
    },
    "executables": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "prefix": "git",
          "action": "allow"
        },
        {
          "pattern": "grep **",
          "action": "allow"
        },
        {
          "pattern": "npm [iur]*",
          "action": "ask"
        }
      ]
    },
    "mcpTools": {
      "rules": [
        {
          "prefix": "github-server:",
          "action": "allow"
        }
      ]
    },
    "readOutsideProject": {
      "rules": [
        { 
          "pattern": "/etc/**", 
          "action": "ask"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Each rule must specify either a `prefix` or a `pattern`, along with an `action` (`allow` or `ask`).
Select the appropriate action type and edit its `rules` array:

| `prefix`  | Set a literal string to match all commands that start with it. <br><br>For example, indicating a `git` prefix allows all `git` commands (`git status`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Rules are evaluated top to bottom, with the first match taking precedence. Thus, in the following example, `npm install`
will ask for permission, but `npm test` will be allowed automatically:

### Agent skills

# Agent skills

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="3"/>

Agent skills are folders with instructions, templates, scripts, and reference materials that provide Junie with 
task-specific context. Skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) 
format and are portable across agents.

Unlike [guidelines](Guidelines-and-memory.md), which are applied with every prompt, agent skills are only invoked when they match
the needs of the current task. Junie follows the skill instructions, loading referenced materials or executing 
bundled scrips as needed.

The added agent skill folders are available both to Junie CLI and [Junie in JetBrains IDEs](Junie-IDE-plugin.md).

## Why agent skills?

Think of skills as cheat sheets that Junie consults when working on specific types of tasks to produce better results.
The benefits of agent skills are:

* **Progressive disclosure:** Each skill's name and description are available to Junie, so it knows what skills exist, 
but doesn't read the full content of a skill until it determines its relevance to the task.
* **Instructions with attached files:** Instructions are bundled with reference materials such as templates or 
assets, so Junie has all the context it needs to complete the task.  
* **Portability**: If your project already has skill folders from other agents (`.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, 
or `.codex/skills/`), Junie CLI will detect them and suggest importing into Junie's `.junie/skills/` directory.


## How Junie CLI uses skills

Junie CLI invokes agent skills *automatically*. It scans folders inside `.junie/skills/` at the user and project 
levels and selects the skills that are relevant to the current task.

### Skill location

Junie CLI looks for skill folders in two locations:

* *Project scope:* `<projectRoot>/.junie/skills/<skill-name>/`. 

  Skills in this folder are available only in the current 
  project, but can be checked into version control and shared across all team members. 
    
* *User scope:* `~/.junie/skills/<skill-name>/` on macOS/Linux or `%\USERPROFILE%\.junie\skills\<skill-name>\` on Windows. 

  Skills in this folder are available globally across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account.

[//]: # (> The default user-level path can be changed by setting the `JUNIE_HOME` environment)
[//]: # (> variable. In that case, skills are loaded from `$JUNIE_HOME/skills/` &#40;macOS/Linux&#41; or `%\JUNIE_HOME%\skills\` &#40;Windows&#41;.)

> If a project-level (`<projectRoot>/.junie/skills/<skill-name>/`) and a user-level (`~/.junie/skills/<skill-name>/`) 
> skills share the same name, the project-level skill takes precedence and the user-level skill is ignored.
> {style="note" title="Scope priority"}

[//]: # (When you add or update skills, Junie CLI notifies you at the start of the next session.)

### Skill directory structure

Each skill lives in its own folder under the `.junie/skills` directory:

```
.junie/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   ├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill documentation
│   ├── scripts/              # Optional: Executable scripts
│   │   └── setup.sh
│   ├── templates/            # Optional: Code or doc templates
│   │   └── component.kt
│   └── checklists/           # Optional: Detailed checklists
│       └── review.md
├── another-skill/
│   └── SKILL.md
```

- The `SKILL.md` file is **required**. A folder without it is not recognized as a skill.
- Subdirectories are optional and can contain any supporting files (checklists, scripts, templates, etc.) that Junie CLI
  can read when needed.

### `SKILL.md` format

The `SKILL.md` file uses Markdown with a YAML frontmatter header:

```Markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A short description of what this skill provides
---

# My Skill Name

Use this skill when [describe when Junie should use this skill].

## Key Principles
- Principle 1
- Principle 2

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2

## Examples

[Include code examples, patterns, or references to project files]

## Checklist

See `checklists/review.md` for a detailed checklist.
```

#### Required frontmatter fields

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                    |
|---------------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | String | **Yes**  | A unique identifier for the skill.                                                             |
| `description` | String | **Yes**  | A short summary that Junie CLI can use to determine the skill's relevance to the current task. |
{width="800"}

#### Body content

The body (everything after the closing `---`) is the main skill documentation, which should contain actionable 
instructions that Junie CLI should follow along with the paths to relevant project files, templates, or additional 
materials within the skill folder.

## Adding a skill

### Prompt Junie to add a skill

The easiest way to add a skill is to ask Junie to create it for you. Describe what you want the skill to cover, 
and Junie will generate the skill folder, `SKILL.md`, and any supporting files.

<procedure>

**Example prompt:**

Create a skill that enforces our API design conventions: all REST endpoints must use kebab-case URLs, return JSON
responses wrapped in a `{ data, error }` envelope, and include request validation using our shared `ValidationUtils`
class. Add a checklist for reviewing new endpoints.

</procedure>

You can also create skills on the fly from your current task if the guidelines or patterns Junie followed 
could be reused in future tasks.

<procedure>

**Example prompt:**

The conventions we've been following for database migrations in this task are useful — create a skill from them so we
follow the same approach next time.

</procedure>

### Create your own skill

1. Create a `.junie/skills/` directory.

2. Add a skill folder to the `.junie/skills/` directory.

3. Add a `SKILL.md` file to the skill folder.

```Markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Provides guidelines for [specific domain or task]
---

# My New Skill

Use this skill when [describe the trigger conditions].

## Key Principles

- [Actionable principle 1]
- [Actionable principle 2]

## Guidelines

- [Specific guideline with examples]
- [Reference to project files: `path/to/relevant/file.kt`]

## Code Patterns

    ```kotlin
    // Example of the preferred pattern
    fun example() {
        // ...
    }
    ```
## Additional Resources

- See `checklists/my-checklist.md` for a detailed checklist.
- Run `scripts/setup.sh` to configure the environment.
```
{collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed" collapsed-title=".junie/skills/my-new-skill/SKILL.md"}

4. (Optional) Add supporting files to the skill folder.

    If your skill needs additional resources, create subdirectories with supporting files.

5. Verify that the skill loads. 

    Ask Junie to list its available skills to confirm it loaded correctly.

[//]: # (Start a new Junie session. You should see a notification that a new skill was detected.)

### Add skills from public repositories

You can import skills shared by the community or your organization by copying them from public Git repositories into
your skills directory.

<tabs>
<tab title="macOS/Linux">

```bash
# Clone the repo (or download just the skill folder)
git clone https://github.com/example/junie-skills.git /tmp/junie-skills

# Copy a specific skill to your project
cp -r /tmp/junie-skills/code-review .junie/skills/

# Or copy to your global skills for use across all projects
cp -r /tmp/junie-skills/code-review ~/.junie/skills/

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/junie-skills]]>
```
</tab>

<tab title="Windows">

```powershell
# Clone the repo (or download just the skill folder)
git clone https://github.com/example/junie-skills.git $env:TEMP\junie-skills

# Copy a specific skill to your project
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $env:TEMP\junie-skills\code-review .junie\skills\

# Or copy to your global skills for use across all projects
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force $env:TEMP\junie-skills\code-review "$env:USERPROFILE\.junie\skills\"

# Clean up
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $env:TEMP\junie-skills]]>
```
</tab>
</tabs>

>Junie modifies your code and executes scripts, so it's important to make sure that the skills it uses are safe.
>Treat third-party skills with the same caution as you would with any third-party code you add to your project:
>
>* Only use skills from sources you trust.
>* Read the `SKILL.md` file and all supporting files carefully.
>* Prefer pinning to a specific commit or tag rather than pulling from a branch that may change.
> 
{title="Always review skills from external sources before using them" style="warning"}

## Best practices

* Be specific and actionable and provide as many details as possible. A good example is: 
  
  ```markdown
  Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert). 
  One assertion concept per test. 
  Use fakes instead of mocking libraries.
  ```

* Include examples and show the exact patterns you want Junie to follow. 
Skills with code examples are significantly more effective. 

* Reference project files. Point Junie to existing code that exemplifies the desired patterns:

    ```markdown
    See `src/test/kotlin/com/example/MyServiceTest.kt` for a reference 
    test implementation.
    ```

* Keep it focused. Each skill should cover one domain or concern. Don't create a single monolithic skill that covers 
everything – create multiple focused skills instead.

* Use subdirectories for complex skills. If a skill has extensive documentation, break it into multiple files:
    - Main `SKILL.md` provides an overview and links to sub-documents.
  - `checklists/` for step-by-step verification lists.
  - `scripts/` for automation scripts Junie can execute.
  - `templates/` for boilerplate code Junie can use as starting points.

* Write a clear description. The `description` field is what Junie uses to decide whether a skill is relevant. 
Make it specific enough that Junie can match it to the right tasks.

## Troubleshooting

<procedure collapsible="true" default-state="collapsed" title="Junie not using a skill">

- Junie selects skills based on task relevance. If a skill isn't being used, it may not match the current task, 
or its description may be too vague or generic. Make sure the skill's `description` clearly communicates when it should be used.
- Try asking Junie to use a specific skill explicitly, for example: *Use the testing skill to write tests for this module.*
- Check for name conflicts: if a project-level and a user-level skills have the same name, the user-level skill will be skipped.
- Verify the [SKILL.md file format](#skill-md-format) is followed: proper YAML formatting (no tabs, correct indentation), 
the YAML frontmatter starts with `---`, contains `name` and `description` fields, and ends with `---`; 
values for both `name` and `description` fields are provided.
- Check file permissions and encoding (UTF-8) for file read errors.
</procedure>

# Code Review Skill

Use this skill when reviewing Kotlin code for quality, correctness, and maintainability.

## Review Priorities

1. **Correctness** — Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Error Handling** — Are errors handled gracefully?
3. **Readability** — Is the code easy to understand?
4. **Performance** — Are there obvious performance issues?
5. **Testing** — Are there adequate tests?

## Kotlin-Specific Checks

- Prefer `val` over `var`
- Use data classes for value objects
- Prefer early returns over nested `if` blocks
- Use sealed classes for restricted hierarchies

### MCP

<show-structure depth="3"/>

# Add and configure MCP servers

You can connect Junie CLI to external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
Junie CLI uses the same MCP JSON configuration as
[Junie in JetBrains IDEs](Junie-IDE-plugin.md#mcp-configuration).

The `/mcp` slash command shows the [list of configured MCP servers](#list-configured-mcp-servers) and the
[MCP Installation Assistant](#mcp-installation-assistant) to guide you through
adding, editing, or troubleshooting configs for MCP servers.

[//]: # (TODO: differentiation between inactive and failed statuses is not clear)

## MCP Installation Assistant

Junie's MCP Installation Assistant is an AI helper that streamlines and simplifies the process of adding new MCP servers.
It guides you through adding MCP servers from a registry of pre-configured servers or from scratch.

When adding a server from the registry, Junie CLI automatically configures the correct command or URL and prompts the user for 
any required secrets or environment variables.

When adding a server from scratch, it searches the [official MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/)
for the proper server configuration, prompts for parameters, env variables, secrets, or API tokens if needed, adds the server
configuration to the `mcp.json` file, and verifies the server startup.

![](mcp_installation_assistant.png){width=680}

### Add an MCP server

1. Use the `/mcp` command to open the MCP server configuration screen.

2. Press `Ctrl+A` to open and search the list of pre-configured MCP servers. 

    If the MCP server you need is not on the list, press `Ctrl+A` once again and follow Installation Assistant's prompts 
to set up the server configuration from scratch.

3. Select the server installation scope:

    * *Project* — MCP server configs are stored in the `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` file at the root of your project. This file
      can be checked into version control and shared across all team members.
        > For project-scope installations, avoid sharing secrets or sensitive environment variables 
      > if the `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` file is committed to version control. 
      > {title="Warning"}

    * *User* — user-scope MCP configs are stored in `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json` and available across all projects
      on your machine while remaining private to your user account.

4. Select the server connection type:

    * *Remote* — Connect to a hosted server via HTTP/HTTPS.

      Junie CLI connects to an MCP server hosted on a remote machine or service.

    * *Local* — Run on your machine (Docker, npx, or binary).

      Junie CLI starts an MCP server instance locally, e.g.
      using the `npx` command or via Docker.

### OAuth authorization

Remote MCP servers that require OAuth authorization are added to the list of configured servers with 
an **Authorization required** status. Use MCP Installation Assistant to set up OAuth authorization:

1. Select the server on the list to open its configuration menu.

2. Select **→ Authorize** and then follow the steps to login in the respective server's browser page that opens.

3. Verify that the server's status has changed to **Active**.

## Add an MCP server from JSON configuration

If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it manually directly to the `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` file 
at the project or user scope. 

The `mcp.json` file uses the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
      }
    },
    "RemoteServer": {
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/v1",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{collapsible="true" collapsed-title="mcp.json"}

Manually added configurations are imported to the list of MCP servers and enabled by default.
To verify that the server is available to Junie CLI and active, use the `/mcp` command.

## List configured MCP servers

To list all configured MCP servers, as well as disable/enable, modify,
or delete existing configurations, use the `/mcp` command. The list shows:

* MCP server name.
* Installation scope (project or user).
* Server status (Starting/Active/Inactive/Disabled/Failed/Authorization required).

> Servers that are neither *Active* nor *Disabled* can be either *Inactive* or *Failed*.
>
> The *Inactive* status indicates that the server is correctly configured and enabled but is not currently running.
>
> The *Failed* status indicates that an error occurred while attempting to connect to the server,
> the server cannot be started or crashes while running.
> This could be due to invalid configuration, authentication failure, missing dependencies, or server's runtime crash.
> {title="MCP server statuses"}

Configuration for MCP servers is stored in the `mcp.json` file at the following default locations:
* **Project scope**: `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` at the root of your project.
* **User scope**: `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json` on your machine.

You can control where Junie searches for MCP configurations using the following command-line options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--mcp-default-locations` | `true` | Enable or disable adding MCP servers from default locations (per user / per project). |
| `--mcp-location <path>` | — | Additional folders where MCP servers should be found. Can be specified multiple times. |

## Enable or disable an MCP server

The MCP servers connected via MCP Installation Assistant or imported from the `mcp.json` file are enabled by default.

To disable a server, list all the configured servers with the `/mcp` command, select the necessary server,
and then select the **→ Disable** action. To enable a previously disabled server, use **→ Enable**.

### Subagents

# Custom subagents

<show-structure for="chapter" depth="3" />

Subagents in Junie extend the built-in logic of the main agent with task-specific instructions that define a tailored system 
prompt, tool restrictions, and usage of models and [agent skills](Agent-Skills.md).

When Junie CLI runs across a task that matches a subagent’s name and description, it delegates this task to that subagent. 
The subagent then works independently in its own context and returns the result to the main agent.

This page describes the [benefits of using custom subagents](#why-subagents), 
[how custom subagents are invoked](#how-junie-cli-uses-subagents), 
[adding your own subagents](#creating-a-custom-subagent) to Junie CLI, and what [built-in tools](#supported-tool-groups) 
are supported.

## Why subagents?

With subagents, Junie CLI can extend the capabilities to the main agent by delegating tasks to the most appropriate handler 
based on the nature of the request. Subagents let you:

* **Break down complex tasks** into focused, single-purpose chunks that the main agent can delegate 
while keeping the subagent's context out of the main conversation.
* **Tailor and reuse agent's behaviour for specific tasks** by defining coding standards, checklists, procedures, or 
agent skills to invoke and reusing these instructions across projects.
* **Optimize performance and costs** by using lightweight models for simple repetitive tasks, or predefined models for
    specific types of tasks.
* **Enforce tool restrictions** for specific types of tasks, such as restricting the agent to read-only operations 
for security auditing and reviews.

## How Junie CLI uses subagents

Junie CLI invokes subagents *automatically*, informing the user which subagent has started 
working on the task.

The main agent discovers all available subagents, selects the relevant subagent by matching its [`name` and `description`](#frontmatter-fields) to the task at hand, 
runs it as a subtask, and brings the result back into the main session.

> Unlike [custom slash commands](Custom-slash-commands.md), custom subagents cannot be invoked manually 
> via slash commands. They are only called automatically through delegation.

> If your project already has agent files from other tools (`.cursor/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, or `.codex/agents/`),
> Junie CLI detects such files when opening the project and suggests importing them into Junie's `.junie/agents/` 
> directory automatically.
{title="Agent import"}

## Creating a custom subagent

Subagents are Markdown files with YAML metadata stored in the `.junie/agents/` or `.agents/` directory. For example, a simple 
subagent file for a changelog assistant (`.junie/agents/changelog.md`) looks as follows:

```yaml
---
name: "changelog"
description: "Write a changelog entry for a PR"
---

You are a changelog assistant.

Given the PR title and description, produce a short changelog entry.
```

### File location

Junie CLI looks for custom subagent `*.md` files in the following locations:

* *Project scope:* `<projectRoot>/.junie/agents/`.
* *Project scope:* `<projectRoot>/.agents/`.
* *User scope:* `~/.junie/agents/` on macOS/Linux or `%\USERPROFILE%\.junie\agents\` on Windows.
* *User scope:* `~/.agents/` on macOS/Linux or `%\USERPROFILE%\.agents\` on Windows.

### File format

Subagent files use YAML frontmatter for metadata, followed by the prompt body in Markdown for the system prompt. 

An example subagent file that uses all available frontmatter fields looks as follows:

```markdown
---
description: "Review a change and propose a safe patch"
name: "code-review-helper"
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Edit"]
disallowedTools: ["Bash", "WebSearch"]
model: "sonnet"
skills: ["kotlin", "writerside"]
allowPromptArgument: true
---

You are a careful code reviewer.

Context:

- File: $path
- Focus area: $focus

Tasks:

1) Explain the issue concisely.
2) Propose a minimal fix.
3) If edits are needed, prepare a small patch.

If you need additional context, ask for it.
```

#### Frontmatter fields

| Field             | Type           | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`            | `String`       | no       | The subagent name. If missing, the file name (without extension) is used. <br><br>Must match: `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*` (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens).                                |
| `description`     | `String`       | yes      | The subagent description. Used by the main agent to decide when to delegate a task to this subagent.                                                                                 |
| `tools`           | `List<String>` | no       | If present and non-empty: an allowlist of [tool groups](#supported-tool-groups).                                                                                                     |
| `disallowedTools` | `List<String>` | no       | A denylist of [tool groups](#supported-tool-groups). Applied after the `tools` filtering.                                                                                            |
| `model`           | `String`       | no       | Model override for this subagent run (if supported by your environment). Accepted values depend on your environment; some builds also support aliases like `sonnet`, `opus`, `grok`. |
| `skills`          | `List<String>` | no       | IDs/names of agent skills to load for the subagent worker (if supported by your environment).                                                                                        |

#### Prompt body

In the prompt body, provide the set of instructions to guide the subagent’s behavior. This prompt will be added to the 
instructions delegated from the main agent.

#### Tips 

* Make delegated work items as independent as possible.
* Ask for specific outputs (for example, “return file paths and the exact symbol names”).
* If you want to keep changes small, say so (“no refactors”, “touch at most one module”, “prefer config-only fix”).

## Supported tool groups

Custom subagents can define which tool groups are allowed (`tools`) or forbidden (`disallowedTools`) during task execution. 

If the `tools` field in the YAML frontmatter is present and non-empty, **only the specified groups are allowed**,
with the rest being banned by default. There's no need to disallow them explicitly using the `disallowedTools` field. 

There are two types of tools that can be either allowed or banned:

* **Built-in tool groups**.
* **Tools provided by MCP servers** (if available in your environment).

The built-in tool group labels are:

| Built-in tool group label | What it enables                                         |                               
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Read`                    | Read-only file viewing actions (open/scroll).           |
| `Bash`                    | Running shell commands in the local environment.        |
| `Glob`                    | Searching for files by path pattern (`glob`).           |
| `Grep`                    | Searching for text by regular expression (`grep`).      |
| `Write`                   | Creating new files.                                     |
| `Edit`                    | Modifying existing files (search/replace, apply patch). | 
| `WebSearch`               | Searching the web for up-to-date information.           | 
| `AskUserQuestion`         | Asking the user for input or a choice.                  |

Example of a read-only subagent allowed to search for a text by regular expression:

```yaml
---
name: "symbol-finder"
description: "Find where a symbol is used and summarize"
tools: [ "Read", "Grep" ]
---
```

### Guidelines and memory

# Guidelines and memory

<show-structure depth="3" for="chapter"/>

## Guidelines

Guidelines allow you to provide persistent, reusable context to the agent. Junie CLI reads guidelines 
from the `AGENTS.md` file and adds this context to every task it works on.

Additionally, Junie CLI checks for any guidelines or memory files from other AI agents when it opens the project
for the first time. If such files are detected, it will suggest importing the instructions into `.junie/AGENTS.md`.

### AGENTS.md

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is an open file format for guiding coding agents. It's a standard Markdown file 
with headings, lists, and plain text that the agents can parse to add to the prompt context. 

[//]: # (For user-defined instructions and project context, Junie CLI reads the `.junie/AGENTS.md` file at the root of your project.)

### How Junie CLI discovers guidelines

When Junie CLI starts a task, it looks for guidelines in the following order:

1. `.junie/AGENTS.md` file in the project root.
2. `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.
3. `.junie/guidelines.md` file or `.junie/guidelines/` folder – Junie's legacy format for guidelines (still supported).

<procedure title="Examples of guidelines">

An `AGENTS.md` file can include project-specific context such as tech stacks, conventions, or rules.
Providing this information helps Junie better understand your environment, avoid incompatible libraries,
and follow your project's specific architectural patterns.

Below are some examples of what you can include:

* **Quick-start checklist:**

```markdown
# A short bullet list of the most critical rules the agent must follow before doing anything

- [ ] Read this file and `README.md` before acting.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes.
```

* **Local development commands**:

```markdown
# A table or list of project-specific commands for install, lint, test, build, and span dev server

| Task                 | Command        |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Install dependencies | `pnpm install` |
| Start dev server     | `pnpm dev`     |
| Run unit tests       | `pnpm test`    |
```

* **Feature development and decision making:**

```markdown
# Feature development and decision making

- Make small, targeted changes instead of building for hypothetical future needs.
- If something is unclear, ask before making assumptions.
```

* **UI and architecture:**

```markdown
# UI and architecture guidelines

- Use existing design system components.
- Avoid inline styles.
- Follow current domain boundaries.
- Prefer extending existing services.
```

* **Security and data handling:**

```markdown
# Security and data handling

- Never log tokens or sensitive data.
- Sanitize all user input and use existing auth middleware.
```

* **Testing and contribution:**

```markdown
# Testing and contribution

- Add unit tests for new business logic.
- Keep changes minimal and avoid large refactors in feature tasks.
- Do not rename files without a valid technical reason.
```

* **Non-goals for agents:**

```markdown
# Explicit prohibitions what agents must NOT do 

- Do not bump major versions of core dependencies without a dedicated PR and discussion.
- Do not change database schema without a corresponding migration file.
```

[junie-guidelines](https://github.com/JetBrains/junie-guidelines) catalog.

### Custom slash commands

# Custom slash commands

Junie CLI supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute frequently used prompts or
repetitive tasks. Custom commands are added to the list of built-in slash commands that is shown when you type `/`.

[//]: # (![]&#40;custom-slash-command.png&#41;{width="706"})

To create a custom command:

1. Use `/commands` → `Create New Command` and provide the command name and description.

2. Select the command scope:
    * *Project-specific commands* are stored as Markdown files in the `.junie/commands` folder at your project’s root directory.
      You can commit this folder to version control to ensure that all team members can use it.
    * *User commands* are stored as Markdown files in the `~/.junie/commands` folder on your machine, making them
      available across all projects you open locally.

3. Enter and save the prompt.

To view, modify, or delete the added custom commands, use `/commands`.

### Use arguments in the command prompt

You can use special keywords `$argumentName` in the prompt text to pass parameter values when invoking
the custom slash command.

For example, if you create a command named *explain* and set the prompt as `Explain the code in $file and suggest improvements`,
the `/explain` slash command should be used with the `file` argument when invoked as follows:

```
/explain file=src/main.kt
```
Argument values may be either unquoted or quoted with double or single quotes.

> A custom slash command will only be executed when all arguments from the command template are provided.
>
> Junie CLI shows inline hints for missing arguments. To autocomplete the missing argument name, use `Tab`.

### Slash command file format

Each custom slash command is saved as a separate Markdown file with YAML frontmatter that defines the command metadata.
The file name is taken from the command name.

For example, a file for the `/explain` command will be named `explain.md` and look as follows:


```markdown

---

description: Explains code in a given file

---


Explain the code in $file and suggest improvements.

```

### Custom LLMs

# Custom LLMs

<primary-label ref="eap"/>

Junie CLI supports custom models defined via JSON profiles. This feature allows you to integrate with local providers 
(e.g., Ollama), enterprise proxies, or any LLM endpoint that follows the supported API formats.

> This feature is currently in the [Early Access program](Junie-CLI-EAP.md). To try it,
> [install the EAP build](Junie-CLI-EAP.md) of Junie CLI.

## Configuration

### Location and discovery

By default, custom models are discovered from JSON files located in:
- User-scope: `$JUNIE_HOME/models/*.json`.
- Project-scope: `.junie/models/*.json`.

The filename (without the `.json` extension) is used as the **profile identifier**.

You can control where Junie searches for custom models using the following command-line options:

| Option                                            | Default | Description                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--model-default-locations` | `true`  | Enable or disable adding custom models from default locations (per user / per project).  |
| `--model-location <path>`  | —       | Additional folders where custom models should be found. Can be specified multiple times. |
{width="800"}

You can also set these values in the `config.json` file. For details, see [Junie CLI configuration files](Junie-CLI-configuration.md).

### Profile structure

A custom model profile consists of a top-level configuration and two optional model roles:

1. **Top-level properties**: Serve as the default configuration (base URL, API key, API type, and extra headers) for the models in the profile.
2. **`primaryModel`**: The model used for main reasoning and code generation tasks.
3. **`fasterModel`**: The model used for internal helper tasks like summarizing context or classifying tasks.

If `primaryModel` or `fasterModel` is not explicitly defined, they inherit the top-level properties.

### Merging logic

Overrides in `primaryModel` or `fasterModel` are merged with the top-level defaults:
- **Simple fields** (ID, base URL, API key, API type) are replaced by the override if present.
- **Headers** (`extraHeaders`) are merged: headers defined in the override are added to the top-level headers.

### Supported API types

Junie supports the following API formats for custom models:
- `OpenAICompletion`
- `OpenAIResponses`
- `Google`
- `Anthropic`

## Example profile

Below is an example of a profile named `local-ollama.json`:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1/responses",
  "id": "qwen3-coder:latest",
  "apiType": "OpenAIResponses",
  "extraHeaders": {
    "X-Custom-Source": "Junie"
  },
  "fasterModel": {
    "id": "qwen2.5-coder:1.5b"
  }
}
```

In this example, the primary model will be `qwen3-coder:latest`, and the faster model will be `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b`. Both will use the same base URL, API type, and extra headers.

## Using custom models

Once a profile is created, you can select it using the `/model` command or the `--model` flag. Custom models are identified by a `custom:` prefix followed by the profile ID:

```bash
junie --model custom:local-ollama
```

In the interactive TUI, custom models appear in the model selection list after the built-in providers.

### Custom proxies

# Custom proxies

<primary-label ref="nightly"/>

Custom proxies let you route Junie's LLM traffic through a self-hosted or third-party proxy endpoint instead of the default JetBrains AI service.
This is useful when your organization runs its own inference gateway, needs to add custom authentication headers, or wants to use a private Ingrazzio-compatible deployment.

> This feature is currently in the [Early Access program](Junie-CLI-EAP.md). To try it,
> [install the Nightly build](Junie-CLI-EAP.md#install-nightly) of Junie CLI.

## About the Ingrazzio proxy {id="about-ingrazzio"}

Ingrazzio is JetBrains' internal proxy protocol that Junie uses to communicate with LLM providers.
The production Ingrazzio endpoint is `https://ingrazzio-cloud-prod.labs.jb.gg`.

When Junie connects through an Ingrazzio proxy, it uses the base URL to access several sub-endpoints:

- **LLM chat** — the base path handles streaming chat completion requests.
- **Web search** — the `/search` path provides web search capabilities.
- **URL extraction** — the `/extract` path fetches and extracts content from URLs.

When using the default JetBrains provider, Junie authenticates automatically via JetBrains Account (JBA).
When using a custom proxy, JBA authentication is bypassed — you must supply any required credentials (such as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) through the proxy's `headers` field.

## Configure a proxy

Add a `proxies` array to your `config.json`. Each entry describes a named proxy endpoint:

```json
{
  "proxies": [
    {
      "name": "my-proxy",
      "kind": "Ingrazzio",
      "api-url": "https://ingrazzio-cloud-prod.labs.jb.gg",
      "headers": [
        "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Proxy fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | A unique name for this proxy. Used to reference it from the `provider` field. |
| `kind` | No | The proxy protocol type. Defaults to `Ingrazzio` if omitted. See [Supported proxy kinds](#supported-proxy-kinds). |
| `api-url` | Yes | The base URL of the proxy endpoint. |
| `headers` | No | A list of extra HTTP headers to send with every request. Each entry uses the format `Header-Name: Header-Value`. |

## Select a proxy as the active provider

To make Junie use a configured proxy, set the `provider` field to the proxy name:

```json
{
  "proxies": [
    {
      "name": "corp-proxy",
      "kind": "Ingrazzio",
      "api-url": "https://ingrazzio-cloud-prod.labs.jb.gg",
      "headers": [
        "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "provider": "corp-proxy",
  "model": "sonnet"
}
```

You can also override the provider at runtime with the `--provider` CLI flag:

```bash
junie --provider corp-proxy
```

When a proxy is selected as the provider, Junie does **not** use JetBrains AI authentication.
All authentication must be handled through the `headers` you configure on the proxy entry.

## Supported proxy kinds {id="supported-proxy-kinds"}

The `kind` field determines which protocol Junie uses to communicate with the proxy.

| Kind | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Ingrazzio` | **Supported** | Junie's native proxy protocol. Compatible with JetBrains Ingrazzio deployments. This is the default when `kind` is omitted. |
| `OpenAI` | Planned | OpenAI-compatible API. |
| `Anthropic` | Planned | Anthropic-compatible API. |
| `JetBrainsAI` | Planned | JetBrains AI Gateway. |
| `OpenRouter` | Planned | OpenRouter-compatible API. |

> Currently, only the `Ingrazzio` kind is functional. Selecting any other kind will result in an error at startup.

## Quick setup example

1. Create a configuration file (for example, `my-config.json`):

```json
{
  "proxies": [
    {
      "name": "my-ing",
      "kind": "Ingrazzio",
      "api-url": "https://ingrazzio-cloud-prod.labs.jb.gg",
      "headers": [
        "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "provider": "my-ing",
  "model": "opus"
}
```

2. Run Junie with the custom config:

```bash
junie --config-location="/path/to/my-config.json"
```

You can still override the model at runtime with the `--model` flag:

```bash
junie --config-location="/path/to/my-config.json" --model sonnet
```

## Merging proxies across configuration files

When multiple configuration files define proxies, they are merged by name:

* If two files define a proxy with the same `name`, the higher-priority file's fields override the lower-priority file's fields on a per-field basis.
* Headers from both files are combined (deduplicated).
* Proxies with different names are all included in the final list.

For the configuration precedence order, see [Configuration files](Junie-CLI-configuration.md#configuration-precedence).

## Limitations

* Only the `Ingrazzio` proxy kind is currently supported. Other kinds are reserved for future use.
* Proxy configuration is only available through `config.json`. There are no dedicated CLI flags for defining proxy entries.
* When using a proxy provider, JetBrains AI authentication is bypassed entirely. You must supply any required credentials via the `headers` field.

### Junie CLI: What is stored on the user's disk

# Junie CLI: What is stored on the user's disk

This document describes what data the `junie` CLI stores on the user's disk, where it is stored, and what it is used for.

## Base `junieHome` directory

The main user directory for the CLI is `junieHome`.

The path is resolved in this order:

1. the `JUNIE_HOME` environment variable
2. the `junie.home` system property
3. the default directory `~/.junie`

Examples:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.junie`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.junie`

## What is stored inside `junieHome`

### `logs/`

Directory for CLI logs. It is created when the application starts.

### `settings.json`

File with CLI user settings.

At the moment, it stores values such as:

- `braveMode`
- `modelForLaunch`
- `selectedTheme`
- `sessionCount`
- `junieId`
- `shareAnonymousStatistics`

Format: JSON.

### `sessions/`

Directory with saved CLI sessions.

Structure:

- `sessions/index.jsonl` — session index, one JSON record per line
- `sessions/<sessionId>/events.jsonl` — session event stream
- `sessions/<sessionId>/state.json` — latest saved agent state

Notes:

- some environment variables inside `state.json` and state events are encrypted through `EnvEncryptionService`
- the index and events are used to restore the history and state of interactive sessions

Format:

- `index.jsonl` and `events.jsonl` — JSONL
- `state.json` — JSON

### `misc/`

Directory for small internal CLI files.

Here, `junie` stores small internal files as separate key-based entries.

#### `misc/config_hashes.json`

Hashes of local custom skill configurations.

Used to track new, updated, and problematic local skill file configurations.

#### `misc/migration_state.json`

Migration state for user and project settings imported from other products.

Contains the list of already processed projects.

### `secure_credentials.json`

Fallback secret storage file.

It is used only when system secure storage is unavailable:

- macOS Keychain
- Windows Credential Manager
- Linux Secret Service

If fallback storage is enabled, secrets are stored in this file as JSON.

This is sensitive data.

### `mcp/mcp.json`

User MCP server configuration.

### `declined_mcps.json`

List of MCP servers declined by the user.

Format: JSON.

### `models/`

Custom user model profiles.

The CLI scans this directory for `*.json` files and loads model profiles from them.

### `agent-skills/`

User agent skills.

The CLI reads skills from:

- `<project>/.junie/agent-skills`
- `<junieHome>/agent-skills`

User files inside `junieHome` are stored in this directory.

## What may be stored outside `junieHome`

### `<project>/.junie/mcp/mcp.json`

Project-level MCP configuration.

It belongs to a specific project rather than global user state.

### `<project>/.junie/models`

Project-level custom model profiles.

These take priority over user profiles from `<junieHome>/models`.

## Short summary

If you only look at the CLI's global user data, the main locations are:

- `~/.junie/settings.json`
- `~/.junie/sessions/`
- `~/.junie/logs/`
- `~/.junie/misc/`
- `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json`
- `~/.junie/declined_mcps.json`
- `~/.junie/models/`
- `~/.junie/agent-skills/`
- `~/.junie/secure_credentials.json` — only if system secure storage is unavailable

The most sensitive locations are:

- `secure_credentials.json`, if fallback storage is used
- the contents of `sessions/`, because they may contain work history and agent state
- user model profiles in `models/`, if they contain keys or custom headers
