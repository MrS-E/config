# Reference

Complete reference for the slash commands (`/`) and shortcuts available in Junie CLI (interactive mode).

## Built-in slash commands

> Commands shown with `<...>` accept optional raw trailing text: Junie CLI passes everything after the command token 
> as one argument. 
> 
> For example, `/new fix failing tests` opens a new session with `fix failing tests` in the prompt. `/plan refactor commands`
> enables plan mode and submits `refactor commands` immediately. 
> 
> Commands without `<...>` do not accept arguments.

| `/model`                 | Select the main Large Language Model (LLM) to be used by Junie CLI and, for supported models, the reasoning [effort level](Junie-CLI.md#model-and-effort). <br><br>`Default` is the recommended pre-selected option with the best price quality ratio. The model behind the `Default` option is set dynamically and may change as new models are released. |
| `/new <prompt>`          | Clear up the context and start a new session.
